    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A deep-fried Oreo is a dessert or snack consisting of a chocolate sandwich cookie which is dipped in batter and deep fried. It may be served with different toppings, most commonly powdered sugar. Deep-fried Oreos are generally made using Oreo-brand cookies, hence the name, but other chocolate sandwich cookies can be used.</p>
